# What do you mean you’re making a CHIP-8 runtime
Hi, I love making devlog. It enables me to write silly little phrases appairing in front
of your eyes! But also it’s a good rubberduck for me to organize my thoughts.

## What?!
I need to get better at C++ and making emulators. It will come with a bunch of boilerplate
because its not a silly litle C project and I "need" to make sure the project can build,
test and run on several platform, including a port to WebAssembly.

### Nix
I don’t think I need to explain CMake. However you may have not heard about Nix the
package manager. It is a package manager like the many you see in other Linux distributions,
expect it isn’t like them.

Declarative like json, but actually a full turing-complete language.
Basically, dev env reproductible. launch tests, a structure. I suggest you give it a try.
